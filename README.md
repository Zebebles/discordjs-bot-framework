#discordjs-bot-framework

##About
A lightweight, easy to use framework for Discord bots that makes creating a [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) bot as easy as 1 2 3 (clichÃ©, I know).

##Installation:
`npm install discordjs-bot-framework`

[GitHub](https://github.com/zebebles/discordjs-bot-framework)

##Setup guide:
###Step 1: Setting up your bot folder
1. Create a folder somewhere named `mybot` or something similar.
2. Create a sub-folder to store all of your commands files in.
3. Open a command prompt window in your bot folder (CNTR+SHIT+RIGHT_CLICK -> Open Command Prompt window here.)
4. Type `npm install discordjs-bot-framework` (make sure you have npm and node installed).

###Step 2: Setting up your main bot file
1. Create a file called index.js or something similar in your bot folder.
2. Open the file with your prefered text editor, and copy-paste the following code.
```javascript
const DBF = require("discordjs-bot-framework");

let TestBot = new DBF.Client({
	author: "your_discord_id_here",                               //  This is used to check if the message was sent by the bot creator for ownerOnly commands
	prefix: "$$",                                                 //  This is used as the prefix for all of your commands.
	cmddir: require('path').join(__dirname, 'commands'),          //  The directory of your command folder. Repalace 'commands' with your commands folder name.
	token: "your_token_here",                                     //  Your bots token.  Anyone who has this can log-in as your bot, so treat it like a password!
	MentionsTrigger: true                                         //  If this is true, @mentions followed by a command name/trigger will trigger the command.  i.e. @YourBot hello
});

TestBot.login();
```
3. Replace all the fields with the relevent information. You can get your bots token [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

###Step 3: Creating your first command.
1. Navigate to the sub-folder you created for all your commands earlier.
2. Create a new file named `helloworld.js`
3. Open the file with your prefered text editor, and copy-paste the following code.
```javascript
const DBF = require('discordjs-bot-framework');

module.exports = class HelloWorld extends DBF.Command{
    constructor(){
        super({
            name: "hello",                                      //  REQUIRED - this is pretty much just another trigger, but can be used filter commands.
            triggers: ["hi", "hey"],                            //  Any string (excluding prefix) that will trigger this command (one word only).
            group: "Misc",                                      //  The command will come under this group.  You can use this to develop a help message and filter commands.
            description: "Sends hello in the channel",          //  REQUIRED -  You can use this to develop a help message.
            example: "$$hello",                                 //  You can use this to develop a better help message.
            ownerOnly : false,                                  //  If the command can only be used by the bot owner. i.e. $$restart or something.
            guildOnly : false,                                  //  Stops any commands that can only be run in guilds from being run in private chats.
	        reqArgs: false,                                     //  If your command requires any args after the command trigger this will pass them into run()
	        reqUser: false,                                     //  If your command requires a user (i.e. $$info @user or something) this will search for one in the message content and pass it into run()
            reqBotPerms: ["SEND_MESSAGES"],                     //  Any permissions that the bot needs to run this command. note that SEND_MESSAGES is checked for automatically and is only being used as an example.
            reqUserPerms: ["SEND_MESSAGES"]                     //  Any permissions that the user should need for the bot to run this command.
        });
    }

    run(params = {"msg": msg, "user": user, "args": args}){     //  All the code for your commands
        let msg = params.msg                                    //  A Discord.js message object.
            , user = params.user                                //  A Discord.js user object, if reqUser is true and one can be found. 
            , args = params.args;                               //  A string containing all characters after the prefix and word that triggered the command. i.e. if the command was triggered by '$$hello test' this would be `test`
        msg.channel.send("Hello world!");                       //  Using the Discord.js message object to communincate with the Discord API.
    }
}
```
4. Open a command prompt window in your bot folder and type `node index.js`
5. Invite your bot to a server and trigger your command by typing `$$hello` in any channel it can see.  Any new message sent in a channel that the bot can see is automatically checked against all the command names/triggers and any command found is executed.
6. Repeat to create more commands but replace the `super({})` fields with all relevent command-specific information.
